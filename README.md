# Causal Inference in Housing and Medical Domains

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced causal inference techniques through two comprehensive case studies: analyzing California housing prices and investigating diagnostic factors in breast cancer treatment. The research implements propensity score matching and double machine learning to identify causal relationships and potential policy interventions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore causal inference methodologies in real-world scenarios
- Demonstrate techniques for estimating treatment effects
- Analyze heterogeneous treatment effects across different subgroups
- Provide data-driven policy insights

## 📊 Case Studies

### 1. Housing Market Analysis
- **Goal**: Evaluate the impact of an income support program on housing prices
- **Key Techniques**: 
  - Propensity score matching
  - Causal feature selection
  - Heterogeneous treatment effect analysis

### 2. Medical Diagnostic Testing
- **Goal**: Investigate the effect of additional diagnostic testing on breast cancer prognosis
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Synthetic treatment assignment
  - Double machine learning
  - Cost-effectiveness analysis

## 🛠 Methodologies

- Propensity Score Matching
- Mutual Information Feature Selection
- Simplified Double Machine Learning
- Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Analysis

## 📈 Key Findings

### Housing Market
- Income support programs have heterogeneous effects
- Lower-income areas benefit more from targeted interventions
- Geographic targeting can significantly improve program effectiveness

### Medical Diagnostics
- Additional testing shows variable benefits across different patient groups
- Large cell sizes and specific diagnostic characteristics influence treatment effectiveness
- Targeted testing can be more cost-effective than universal screening
